# SilverScript
An interpreted language, written in Java.

## Why another language?
SilverScript is a project to help me grasp how interpreters and compilers work. Also it is a lot of fun!

## Hopes for SilverScript?
One hope for silverscript is to actually be a useful programming tool. Either for prototyping, simulation, or
quick heres and theres.

## SilverScript at the moment merely supports basic equations such as '5 + 3 - 4 / 8 % 2', etc.
